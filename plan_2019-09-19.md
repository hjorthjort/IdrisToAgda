Transpiler implementation
=========================
[x] Make map of Evaluate.hs
[x] Make map of TT.hs
[ ] Make map of AbsSyntaxTree.hs
[ ] Write a Agda test program where universe levels matter
[ ] Translate it manually to Idris
[ ] Write a Idris test program where universe levels matter
[ ] Translate it manually to Agda
[ ] Make sure the translator does not crash on test program 1
[ ] Make sure the translator does not crash on test program 2
[ ] Explore the local information available to "itaUniverse" or similar
[ ] Look through the type graph for possible points of info

### Index / parameter subproject:
Goal: a working itaData - but this may be a too big challenge.
- fallback: what kinds of types are actually used in SeqDecProbs?
   Identify them (vectors + 1-2 more), cut into minimal test file
   work on the itaData until they work [ignoring more complex indices etc.]
