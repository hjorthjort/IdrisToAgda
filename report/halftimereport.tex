\section{Introduction}

% * Background to the assignment. Why is it relevant?
Agda~\cite{agda} and Idris~\cite{idris} are two dependently typed programming
languages.  Agda is mainly focused on interactive theorem proving while Idris
prioritizes general purpose programming.  However, while both languages have
different focus, they share most of their features. Their type systems are
similar. They are not equal however. This leads to a lot of duplicated effort
especially when writing libraries, since they can't be used with languages.

% Mostly the same as the proposal. And read a few other dependent types
% paper-intros, and write something similar.

% * Aim for the work. What should be accomplished?  TODO Decide if to use
% dashes for source-to-source
We wish to investigate if it is possible to construct a source-to-source
compiler from Idris to Agda. The source-to-source compiler, from here called
transpiler, should handle the common subset of Idris and Agda. The languages
are not the same, so we will not work on features only present in Idris. It
would be a lot more work to correctly translate 100\% of the languages,
certainly to much for a master's thesis. However, since the languages are so
similar, the common subset of features is probably more then enough for
a useful transpiler.
% The translation should handle as large subset of Idris as
% possible, but it is unreasonable to expect to cover 100\% of the language.

% TODO Decide if to call it translator, transpiler or compiler

This transpiler would allow Idris libraries to be reused in Agda. This would
greatly increase the number of availible Agda libraries instantly. And increase
the audience for every new Idris library.  It will also increase the confidence
of a given proof if it is valid in both type systems. It is unlikley that both
type-checkers will have the same bug.

The transpiler should preserve the semantics of the translated program.
Otherwise it would not be a useful tool. However, it is hard to formally verify
that this is the case, especially with an incomplete transpiler. Even if it is
possible to run both the source and the translated program and compare their
output, is hard to prove that it is valid for all possible inputs.

There will not be any consideration for run-time characteristics of the
translated program. An efficient Idris program may well be translated into an
unusably slow Agda program. The run-time of a dependently typed program is not
a well understood subject. And it depends a lot on the internal working of the
compiler, which can change with every new version.


The first challenge is to find the common subset of features for which it is
possible to translate. The task is then to construct a compiler which handles
as much of this subset as possible.
A goal to explore for further projects is to do bidirectional translation
between the languages.



% TODO Should this part be in the final report
% \section{Limitations}
% * Limitations. What should be left out and why?
% TODO This part needs to be improved.
Only translation from Idris to Agda will be considered in this project. We will
target Idris 1.3.1 and Agda 2.6.0. It is not feasible to translate every
language feature and edge case.  The goal is to cover a large subset of Idris
features, but it is hard to give an exact goal.  The translator will built step
by step, supporting a bigger subset of language features for each step. The
translator should be usable early on and then improved.
% progression, and where it's reasonable to land.

% Code which is untranslateable
% should be left as holes, with the source as comments.
There may be valid Idris code which is impossible to translate to Agda. There
may also be code where the correct translation is application dependent. Those
parts will be left as holes for the user to fill in a reasonable translation in
that specific case.

% Dependent records

% Cummutally Set hierarchy. Type in type in Idris.
% Remove since Idris has different levels of Set as well, only it is always

\section{Background}
% TODO Change from "The Problem" to "Background".

Dependently typed programming is the application of
% Martin-Löf
% TODO
% Maybe mention about other forms of type theories. Agda is explicitly based on
% Martin-Löf, it says so in the first paragraph of the documentation.
% "It is an extension of Martin-Löf’s type theory, and is the latest in the
% tradition of languages developed in the programming logic group at Chalmers."
Intuitionistic Type Theory~\cite{martinlof} to practical programming.  Types
are allowed to depend on values, which allows the compiler to check much richer
properties about the program than Hindley-Milner~\cite{hindley}~\cite{milner}
style types.

Agda and Idris are two of the mostly widely used dependently type programming
languages. They have many features in common. The Idris website states that
Idris is inspired by Agda but with more focus on practical
programming.\footnote{\url{http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/faq/faq.html\#what-are-the-differences-between-agda-and-idris}}

% TODO Refer to the Idris paper instead.
Agda is developed as a research language, with the focus on interactive theorem
proving.  An automatic translator form Idris to Agda source code could increase
the usefulness of both languages. The work of implementation of it can give us
greater knowledge of the differences between the type systems. As well as the
strengths and weaknesses of both languages.

\subsection{Dependently Typed Programming}

Dependent types can be seen as an extension to a algebraic type system which
allow types to depend (predicated) on vaules. I.e. types and values can be
intermixed. A common example is a vector type which is idexed on the length of
the vector. This allows the programmer to encode constraints and invariants in
the type system. For example see the signature for \texttt{head} and
\texttt{tail} below.  For \texttt{head} to type check it requires a vector of
length less than 1, and can therefore never fail. \texttt{tail} is likewise
known to always return a vector of length minus one. The compiler also
guarantees that the implementation of the functions follow the properties
encoded in the types, other wise they will not compile.  This mixing of values
and types goes both ways, types are values and values are types.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% TODO Improve this section. It is maybe unnecessary, and not rellay relevant
% to my thesis.
Dependent types can be used for proof, see Curry-Howard. But also for providing
strong correctness guarantees. Which is useful for safety critical systems.

Dependent types can be seen as the next step in the progression.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Algebraic types
  \item Parametric Algebraic types
  \item Generalized Algebraic Data Types
  \item GADTs
  \item Full Dependent Types
\end{enumerate}

Parametric Algebraic types allow for parametric polymorphism, as used in
Haskell. This means we can write generic functions like:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Lambda]
    forall a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
\end{lstlisting}

Generalized Algebraic data types allow data constructors whose return values
are parametrized diffrently. In Haskell syntax:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
data Expr a where
  EBool :: Bool -> Expr Bool
  EInt :: Int -> Expr Int
\end{lstlisting}

Compare to Dependent types where the return type is allowed to depend on both
the type and the \textit{value} of the type variable.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
data Vector : Type -> Nat -> Type where
  Nil : {a : Type} -> Vec a 0
  Cons : {a : Type} -> {n : Nat} -> a -> Vector a n -> Vector a (n + 1)

a : Vector Int 10

head : Vector a (Suc n) -> a
tail : Vector a (Suc n) -> Vector a n
\end{lstlisting}

% TODO Talk about parametrized types and indexed types, and their differences.
% It will be useful later, when talking about problems with my implementation.
% Maybe in the Idris subsection.


% TODO No headings with a single paragraph
\subsubsection{Termination}

For dependent types to be decidable and consistent every program needs to
terminate. Otherwise type checking may take an infinite time.  Both Agda and
Idris requires programs to terminate by default, but the termination check can
be bypassed explicitly. This is useful for many programs, especially
interactive programs, however, it means that the logic is not consistent and
therfore can prove false statements.

% TODO No headings with a single paragraph
\subsection{Source-to-Source translation}
% TODO Write a general introduction about transpilers/source-to-source etc.
% TODO Find a few relevant articles

A source-to-source compiler, often called a transcompiler or transpiler, is
a compiler which translates source code in one programming language into
another language, usually of similar level of abstraction. A traditional
compiler takes a higher level language as input and outputs a lower level
language, often machine code.  Since Agda and Idris are similar languages we will write a transpiler.


\subsection{The Idris programming language}
% TODO Write about Idris and its major features for the programmer. Especially
% how it differs from theory and Agda.


% TODO Talk about implicit vs. explixit arguments
\subsubsection{Implicit arguments}


% TODO How should this section be in the half-time report?
% A lot of this is already stated earlier in the introduction.
\subsection{Goals}
% Semi-automatic translator is maybe a more correct description.
The goal of this project is to construct a semi-automatic translator which can
translate a subset of Idris into valid Agda. The language features which are
not yet implemented will be left as holes to allow the user to provide the
missing parts.

% I should mention which parts are extra hard. Like: dependent types, records,
% classes/interfaces. Implicit arguments. Maybe partial functions. But I'm not
% sure which parts are yet.

% I should some paper related to transpiling and cite. As well as both Idris and
% Agda implementation-papers. Maybe the faq about differences between the
% languages.

Dependent type systems are still an active research topic, it is not obvious
how to determine if two statements in differents systems are equal. This is
a big challange when trying to show that the transpiler works correctly.  Even
if both the source and translated programs type-check, it does not necessarily
mean the translation is correct.

% How to test and verify to translations? It's not feasible to get a lot
% of code runnable without manual intervention. Can I even get it to type check?
% And what does it mean just that the code is well typed in both languages.
% Equality is hard, especially with dependent types.
It is not obvious how to verify the translation, ideally the translated
programs both type check and can be run. Then it would be possible to compare
the outputs are the same. However it is hard enough to get the programs to type
check without manual intervention. The type systems are similar but not
identical. This means that even if both the source and translated program
type check we can not be sure that they represent the same semantics.
Especially if one of the programs contain holes. It is hard to reason about
equality in the context of dependent types.
% TODO Add specific Ideas about how to verify the implementation.
% Ideas:
% -
% -

% TODO This is part of limitations I belive. It should be higher up.
Where the translator fails we wish to leave holes for the user to provide the
correct translation. The holes must be constructed so that this is possible
which is not obvious to do.


% TODO START HERE
\section{Method}
% * Method of accomplishment. How should the work be carried out?
The first step is to translate simple declarations of types and functions,
without dependent types. A subset roughly corresponding to Simply Typed Lambda
Calculus. Since dependent types are the focus of the project the next step is
to translate them. Starting with application in the type level, and functions
definitions. Continuing with indexed data types.
Both Idris and Agda are large languages, some features are more important to
implement then other.  For example \texttt{mutual}-blocks and
\texttt{do}-notation. They are de-sugared in the Idris compiler so are not
strictly necessary to implement. However correctly translating them will
increase the readability and the usefulness of the generated code.
% TODO Talk about the type language.
% type lang
% base types
% variable
% application t1 t2
% function definition (x : t1) -> t2

% Sum/ simple enumeration T | F
% prod/data P = P Bool Bool

% Indexerad data typer

% Kriteriet for att oversatta eller inte ar inte om det ar latt eller
% svart. Both Idris and Agda are large languages. What features are most
% important to translate?

% Developing from the Idris 1 codebase, utilizing as much of the AST
% and pretty printer from the Agda-source as possible.

We wish to reuse the Idris complier front-end for our implementation, by
implementing the translator as a back-end. Hopefully we can reuse the abstract
syntax tree (AST) definition and pretty-printer from the Agda implementation as
well. This means that most of the code needed is handling the actual
translation, minimizing work needed on surrounding infrastructure.  However,
there is always a challenge to interface with existing code.

% | Below is stated elsewhere.
% Another hard task is to find the biggest common subset of the languages.
% It is trivial to name a few common features, bu a useful compiler needs to
% support most widely used features. But there are incompatible differences
% between Agda and Idris which complicates things.

Working step by step, we first translate only very simple programs, then adding
more and more features. Currently unimplemented features are represented with
holes so that it is always possible to translate code. The output becomes more
and more complete as the project progresses. The number of holes left for
a given project also works as an informal method of verification, less holes
corresponds to a better translator.

To test the implementation we will use the Sequential Decision Problem (SDP)
implementation in
IdrisLibs\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/botta/IdrisLibs}} which
is one of the bigger Idris codebases available. This will guide our
implementation by first supporting the features used in the core parts of the
SDP library. And then work to support more and more of the library.

% TODO No headings with a single paragraph
\subsection{Implementation}
Both Agda and Idris 1 are written in Haskell.
% Both implementations use GADTs.
% TODO Talk about reusing their implementaions.
% And something about ASTs


% Method
% ------

Ideally we will define a new intermediate language which covers the union of
Agda and Idris features. This will make it simpler to translate to and from
both languages. We can also use QuickCheck to generate test programs in this
intermediate language to test the code generation. This is not done yet.
Language features in the source languages which are not supported in the target
language will either fail the translator, as they are not possible to represent
in the intermediate language, or require to be compiled down to simpler
language feature before being translated in to the intermediate. If this is
done it would probably be very helpful for the target language implementors if
they would want to implement that feature in the future.



\subsection{Statistics tool}
In the course of the project we needed a way to prioritize languages features
to implement in the translator. Ideally we want the translator to handle
as much real-world code as soon as possible. To guide our implementation we
wrote a tool which parses Idris into its AST and then records which data
constructors are most often used.

"Future:" Then we ran this tool on the 'IdrisLibs' Sequantial Decision
Problems library. See the results in figure. Right now the translator handles
XX of YY constructors of the Idris Term language and ZZ of WW constructors of
the declaration language.

We aim to have implementend ?? of the most widely used constructors when this
project is done.


\subsection{Verification}
How to verify corectness of the translation is hard. Especially while work is
in progress, because if the translation is not complete the program won't
compile.

\begin{itemize}
\item The first step if is the program compiles.
\item Then if it runs without errors.
\item The next step would be to test the translated program with automatic tests.
  But this is often hard to do fully, and depeneds on the program under test.
\item Finally we could formally prove the program correct and that it is the same
  as the source program. This very much work, and far outside the scope of this
  project.
\end{itemize}

It is also possible to compare the output to hand-translated programs, however,
there are few such programs in Agda and Idris.

In a perfect world we would have test suit with many different programs
translated and proven correct in many languages. To compare our compilers to.
But even then it is not obvious to prove correctness, since programs may look
very different but stil do the same thing.

Ideally we would run both the source and translated program with randomized
input to automatically test the they return the same result. However, it is
probably infeasible to get larger programs to type check and run without manual
intervention.  Therefore we will use weaker forms of validation.

Hopefully we can use the Agda compiler to test if the generated programs
compiles. We can also use this (maybe) to guide are translator, if the final
program does not compile it needs to be redone. Or the translator needs to be
more explicit in that spot. This however require us to keep the source
positions during the translation. Both the Agda and Idris does this, but are
translator does not now.

To formally prove correctness of the translation is the ideal verification, but
it is far outside the scope of this project, so we will have to settle for less
rigorous methods. It is the safest way, and what would provide full confidence.
But hopefully we can still provide some degree of confidence in the
translation.

\subsection{Progress}

We have constructed a translator from a subset of Idris to Agda. It handles the
expression language, type signatures and data declarations.  It fails for
implicit argument, which has to be declared in Agda but not in Idris. The
translator re-uses both the Idris parser and the Agda pretty-printer from their
main implementations. This has several advantages. But also many drawback, much
time has been sunk into working with and most often around the existing code.
Real-life implementations make a lot of practiacal considerations which
complicates the code a lot, and are not relevant for an academic project.

Both projects are imported as git submodules in this projects repo, which means
all changes we have made, to the official implementations are recorded and
possible to apply again, on updated version. However, we took care to make as
few changes as possible to keep the posibillity to use the latests versions in
the future. But since the code depends on a lot of internal interfaces, it will
still be hard to keep up.

Just the problem of building both project with the same version of GHC and
dependencies took some time. It was doable however. Unfourtunally it was a very
manual process of comparing cabal-files and trying to find versions of
dependencies which matches both. And in some cases change one project to use
a more recent version of a dependency with a updated interface.

Implicit arguments are only known and calculated in the elaboration step of
Idris compilation. There for it is hard to translate them after only parsing.

% My progress so far
% TODO
%
We have developed a tool to translate simple Idris programs into agda. It works
for a subset of Idris, namely:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Data declarations
  \item Simple expressions
  \item And some more things
\end{enumerate}

We have not yet proven correctness except for manual inspection.
But the translation type checks. It's a medium good verification method. But the
goal is the have a more thorough verification in the end of the project.

In the pbeginning the proces was to run the translation, then try to load the
program in Agda and see if it compiles. The manually fix it so that it
compiles, then changing the translator to do the same thing we just did
manually. % Remove last sentance probably.

The translator does not handle implicit arguments yet. Agda and Idris av
different type checkers, Agda requires more explicit definitions. A implicit
argument used have to at least be defined. Idris automatically considers all
lower case variables in type signatures to be a implicit variable. Since the
implicit arguments in Idris are elaborated in the Type checker we can not use
the parser output to reconstruct them. First Idris is translated to
\texttt{tt\_elab} and the the type checking and elaboration is run.

Therefore we need to run the elaboration and then extract the implicit
arguments from the \texttt{tt} representation and then translated them to Agda.
We are going to do this in a preprecessing step before the translation, we
translate the \texttt{tt} back into regular Idris. This makes it possible the
then just use the normalt \texttt{ita} translator. This has the side effect of
making that translation useful for a Idris automatic refactoring tool. It is
often useful to change between implicit and explicit arguments when developing
a dependently typed program.

% Something something about the crazy Idris implementation with a big state
% monad used everywhere with a huge state. Its almost an imperative program,
% just written in haskell.

We pull in both Idris and Agda sources as git submodules in our project
repository, this makes it possible to record the exact changes we have done to
the upstream sources. To make it easy to reproduce and extend. It also allows
use to pull in newer versions of both projets, and the using git rebase, replay
our changes on top of the newer versions, and make it much easier to maintan
our tool for future language versions.

\subsubsection{Statistics tool and its results}
We have a tool wich loads Idris files and parser them. It then uses the
Declaration/Term AST to calculat wich languages features are used and how often
they are used. See some results from IdrisLibs SDP below.

This was used to guide and prioritize the implementation of the main tool. For
the most part it matches our intuitive guess. But it gives us a better arguemnt
for that the translator is useful, even though it is unfinished.

\subsubsection{Implementation difficulties}
As expected we ran it to a lot of non project related difficulties when trying
to reuse existing Agda and Idris sources.

The Idris compiler is quite stateful, most of it uses a state monad with a huge
state, It is almost like an imparative program, just writen in Haskell. The
often touted benefits of functional programming goes out of the window, but the
compiler is still happy. It goes to show that functional programming is not
a miracle cure for bad programs, that is still up to the programmer.

Just trying to find the internal interface of the Idris parser took a long
time.

Idris uses a custom build process which was a pain to use with a different
folder structure. Since we wanted to pull in both Idris and Agda as `git`
submodules in our repo we needed to change the folder structure and the build
process. The was maybe not worth the effort.

The next version of Idris is developed from scracht in a new project, and some
of the reasons for that is the current implentation, and the difficulties in
working with it.

Trying to reuse the Agda AST as well has many problem. The good thing is that
Agda is designed to be able to print it's ASt back out in the exact same
representations as the input. However, this means that the parser, AST and
pretty print has to keep track of a lot of things, not needed for the sematics
of the program. This made it hard to reconstruct a valid AST from another
program, we had to guess what parts of the data structure are meaningful or not
for our usecase. And many times construct dummy data just to keep the compiler
happy, while not makeing any difference for the output. We still felt this was
an ok tradeoff, since constructing a AST and pretty printer from scracth would
probably be an equal amount of work, but it would be much more work to keep it
in synch with newwer versions of Agda, so the final tool would be less useful.
