\section{Results}

WE have created a tool which translates Idris source code into Agda. The
resulting Agda code can compile and work probably if the Idris source don't use
most language feature.

However Agda and Idris handles universe levels differently so code which relies
on universe cumulativley won't work in Agda. The transpiler doesen't account
for universe levels so int only works on level 1 which is something else.
