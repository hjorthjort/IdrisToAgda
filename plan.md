Try to complete 3 tasks per day until thursday 3/10. The you will evaluate and
proceed to four a day only if it works fine. Otherwise continue for one more
week. Four tasks per day should be a good tempo to finish.

### Index / parameter subproject:
Goal: a working itaData - but this may be a too big challenge.
- fallback: what kinds of types are actually used in SeqDecProbs?
   Identify them (vectors + 1-2 more), cut into minimal test file
   work on the itaData until they work [ignoring more complex indices etc.]
